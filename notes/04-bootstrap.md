# Bootstrap

add debug link, always put debug in body

container-fluid removes all padding/margin from edge of screen

min height and width will grow with content

background img- make into a div, add a class to div (mast-head) go to css, add attributes min-height background-image: url(...), if img doesnt fit right use background-size: ? ,

container is what holds rows, columns go in rows

if row isnt inside of container that might be the reason for side scroll

text-center to center text

you can use going over 12 to your advantage because it will wrap around ex. col-2, col-9, col-4, the col-4 will wrap totally and leave the col-1 remainder as empty space on the row above

center something in middle of page-

100vh is 100% of page, h-100 is 100% of container

try to avoid adding d-flex to columns

rounded-pill

px-padding on x axis, py-padding for the opposite

fw-bold, fw stands for font weight

button functionality- change <button> to <a> to link to website or on scroll. Add href = "#..." to the button. add an id to the div that you want to scroll to with "#..."

add alt to img tag for accessibility

add img-fluid to make the image as big as it can be without coming out of container
