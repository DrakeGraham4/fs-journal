## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

   I think box shadow is probably my favorite tool that improves the design and look of a page.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

   The Cheating at Design article that is attached to that as well as googling different design ideas

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

   I know when I go to a site and it seems outdated or is ugly it makes me wary of using the product that the website is showing. I think when using design on a page you can make it a lot more inviting which will make people want to navigate your website.
