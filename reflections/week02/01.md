## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

   Scope is dependent on whether it is in the global scope or the local scope. Global scope means that it can be used throughout the whole window, local scope normally means it is within a function and can only be used or read within that function.

2. What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is a mechanism where variables the declaration of variables and functions are moved to the top of their scope before the execution of the code. Which means that they could be undefined before the function is carried out.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

Let is blocked scoped and is a variable that can be changed but not redeclared. Const can be cannot be updated or re-declared. There is no reason to use var anymore.
