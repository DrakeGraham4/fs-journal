## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

A function declaration, a function expressions and an arrow function. They all generally do the same thing but the differences are the way they are written.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters are used when defining a function, they are the names created in the definition. Arguments are the values the values the function receives from the parameters when the function is invoked.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
   A higher order function is a function that accepts functions as parameters and/or returns a function.
   An example would be the filter function or a forEach loop.
