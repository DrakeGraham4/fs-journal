## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

The purpose of encapsulation is to be able to write code thats access is restricted from outside of that bundle.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

Leaked implementation details, expanded attack surface for hackers. If you use the underscore prefix you are relying on all users to know what it means. If you use encapsulation you don't have to worry about that.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

Using the hash prefix. We do this to let other programmers know not to touch those varibales.
