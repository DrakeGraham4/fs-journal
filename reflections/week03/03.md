## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

Get and set.

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

Use a custom override called trap. Which is an object with a set of traps that trigger every time the object property is being accessed.

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

You can use a proxy object to to override the get operator so that the user can't access the property, which makes your code harder to access and manipulate from their end.
