> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

When people try to write Javascript in a way where execution happens visually from top to bottom. A lot of people think it reads like other languages but Javascript is different.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

Asynchronous means that may takefunctions some time to run and that they will happen in the future. Callbacks are involved when something in your application may take awhile to download such as videos or gifs. So you store the code in a function that should run after the download is complete

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

Split functions into smaller functions, use async/await, write comments
