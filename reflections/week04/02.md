## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

Pending, Resolved and Rejected

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

They seek to resolve the issues of callback hell by using them to keep the code clean and we can attach callbacks rather than passing them.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

The 'then' method is used only if a Promise is resolved, the 'catch' method is used for rejected Promises
