## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

Linking, embedding and bucketing

One-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

Embedding gets the information with a single call and linking just links the two objects together

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
   It's easiest to map out the potential relationships and find the righe balance. If the information is balanced to both sides it seems like a many to many relationship would be appropriate. If not, a one to many would make most sense
