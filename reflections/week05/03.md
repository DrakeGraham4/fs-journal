Timeboxing is when you set a certain amount of time to spend on a problem and then strategically decide when to move on to the next to give yourself a break.

Practicing and adapting and I will do so by implementing another strategy by setting up a timer on my phone to get used to this strategy

I've benefitted a number of times because sometimes when I'm stuck on an issue and I take a break from it I can come back and see the issues almost immediately
