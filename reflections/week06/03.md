## Questions

1. What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

They are a way to look in to how the library you're using works behind the scenes. They are used by allowing you to know when your component is being added, created, updated or deleted

2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

Using onMounted has shown me that whatever is passed through there is being loaded when the page opens or is refreshed

3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?

They pretty much work just like a constructor method when using controllers in the past. We use them to run our methods on page load
