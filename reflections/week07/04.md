## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

I definitely used the first reading about partner programming when taking my partners feelings into consideration. We switched roles often and made sure that we were both happy with how things were going.

2. What went well this week?

I think the entire project went well, we had a couple of hiccups but overall it was a great experience.

3. What would you do differently?

I would have asked more questions in class and spoke up a little more about how I was feeling with what we were bringing to the table.
