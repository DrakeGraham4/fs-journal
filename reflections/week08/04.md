## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit testing, component testing, End-To-End (E2E) testing

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I think end to end testing would be the most useful method of testing because it allows you to test and provide coverage on what actually happens when your clients use the appllications that you make.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

I think just unit testing would be the least useful because while you may gain confidence in your code, it seems like a slower way of testing things and you are not able to see your end result of your efforts.
