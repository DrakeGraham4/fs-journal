# Weekly Reflection

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts

- What went well this week?

I think the capstones are going really well.

My confidence in my back end skills is lacking

The backend of some of these more intricate applications are a lot more complicated than I anticipated.

Getting through the largest chunk of this class and moving on to the final.
