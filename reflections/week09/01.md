## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We have used a UML diagram to show our relationships, figma for the layout, bootstrap and css for styling as well as vue for the front end.

2. What went well so far?

I think that we all agree on how we want our application to look as well as how we want the functionality to work

3. What would you do differently? Why?

I would have more frequent stand ups in the beginning and explain how everything is working so that when we switch between back end and front end we aren't going into it blindly.
