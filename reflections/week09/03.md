## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

Base64 encoded images were used to represent binary data in text format because it is an encoding schema to store data while embedding an image into a database.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

Base64 causes the browser to have to decode the strings and images causing a heavier workload that isn't needed. Base64 also increases bandwidth because it makes it so the browser cant store the image locally. Base64 also increases the file size by more than 25% which makes for a much heavier file which can lead to everything slowing down.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

In the past, web browsers had a limit on how many connections could be sent to a server, so if there was an image heavy website, it would have to wait a long time for all of the images to load. Base64 for was developed to help that issue, but now we have the technology so we don't have to worry about that issue any longer and now Base64 is obsolete.
