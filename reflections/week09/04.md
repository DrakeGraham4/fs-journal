## Questions

1. What is an SSL certificate?

SSL certificates are a small data files that cryptographically establish an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and browser remain private.

2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?

Extended Validation which shows the padlock, HTTPS, business name, and business country in the address bar to diminish being mistaken for a spam website, this is the most expensive SSL certificate because it shows the legitimacy of your website right on the address bar.

Organization Validated which is used to verify that your organization and domain validation are real. Organization Validated (OV) SSL certificates offer a medium level of encryption and are obtained in two steps. First, the CA would verify who owns the domain and if the organization is operating legally. You would use this type of certificate if you don't quite have enough money for the Exdended Validation certificate but still want to offer a medium level of encryption and legitamcy.

Domain Validation certificate offers a low level of encryption, it is the quickest validation that you can receive but it will not vet any identity data which means that you won't have access to who is receiving your encrypted information.

Wildcard SSL certificate ensures that if you buy a certificate for one domain, you can use the same one for subdomains

Unified Communications certificate allow multiple domain names to be on the same certificate. The only difference bewteen this cert and an extended validation cert is the number of domain names associated with it.

A Single Domain SSL protects one domain. The thing to remember about this certificate is that you canâ€™t use it to protect subdomains or a completely different domain.

3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?

SSL certificates secure and encrypt information between a website and the user. Having an SSL certificate gives you a boost on google sites because of the encryption.
