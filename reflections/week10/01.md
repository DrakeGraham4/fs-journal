## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value Type, Reference Type, Pointer Type

A data type is a value type if it holds a data value within its own memory space. It means the variables of these data types directly contain values.

A reference type doesnâ€™t store its value directly. Instead, it stores the address where the value is being stored. In other words, a reference type contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data.

Pointer types do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object. Also, boxing and unboxing do not support pointers. However, you can convert between different pointer types and between pointer types and integral types.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort. I notice that there are a lot more data types compared to Javascript

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Reference types do not store their own value, a reference type will have a pointer to a different location that holds its data
