## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are constants with unique types, A use case for them would be to give a set of data values different names that are easier to reference.

2. How can you modify an Enum?
   You cannot modify an enum once it is created.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I have not used Enums in my afternoon projects so far and I'm not sure how I would have in any of them. I would say a good way to use them would be if I had to refer to days of the week. Rather than using numbers to represent them I could use enums to change them from a numeric value to their actual name.
