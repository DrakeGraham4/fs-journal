## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance allows us to describe a relationship between two classes. It allows us to reuse code between the two classes.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

Member inheritance in c# enables you to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in other classes. The class whose members are inherited is called the base class and the class that inherits members is the derived class. No, a class does not inherit all members of the base class.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

In affects inheritance by what you can and cannot see in the subclass. It only affects whether the classes derived from the derived class can access the members they inherited.
