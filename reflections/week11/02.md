## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

A primary key is used to identify records on the tabe that you have created, they must be unique and cannot be null. We use the primary key as a foreign key on another table that we want to be able to populate with the information of the primary key.

2. What is an `Alias`?

We use an alias in our SQL statements to make our column names more readable as well as being able to tell the difference between tables. When you are joining tables, sometimes two tables will have the same properties and you need to be able to tell them apart.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,

  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

SELECT
d.*,
p.*
FROM doctors d
JOIN patients p ON p.id = d.patientsId
WHERE d.id = id;
