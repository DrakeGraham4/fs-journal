## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I think this course has been very helpful but on the other hand very challenging. I came into this course without even knowing how to split screen my laptop and now I'm hopefully going to be able to graduate this course knowing how to build full stack web applications. My biggest concern going into this final is getting overwhelmed with the content. I need to take everything one step at a time so I don't get overwhelmed with the workload. I plan on managing my time by taking a break every hour and taking this challenge in a slow and methodical manner. What I have enjoyed most in this course is getting to know everyone, my peers as well as my instructors.
